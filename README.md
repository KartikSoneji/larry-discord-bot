# Larry the Metaplex Discord Bot 

Larry is a suite of three separate bots with three independent functions.
1. The docs bot
2. The kick on join bot
3. The scam/spam bot banner

Larry splits these functions into three bots to both allow for more modularity, and to improve each of the bots performance.

## The Docs Bot: 
The first bot allows you to hook into any Algolia DocSearch index and uses the interaction autocomplete functionality to make it easy for users to query documentation.

## The Kick on Join Bot:
This bot checks members on join and compares their username to that of the moderation team of a server. If it matches, the user is immediately kicked and the team is alerted.

## The Scam/Spam Bot Banner:
The third and final bot essentially puts an end to bot raids. You can look under the hood to check how it does this. 
>TODO:
> - [ ] Finish this bot
